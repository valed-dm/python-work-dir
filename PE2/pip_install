If you’re a system administrator, you can install pygame using the following command:

# pip install pygame

If you're not an admin, or you don't want to fatten up your OS by installing pygame system-wide, you can install it for you only:

# pip install --user pygame

We encourage you to use:

# pip show pygame

# and

# pip list

# to get more information about what actually happened.




The pip install has two important additional abilities:

it is able to update a locally installed package – e.g., if you want to make sure that you’re using the latest version of a particular package, you can run the following command:

# pip install -U package_name


where -U means update. Note: this form of the command makes use of the --user option for the same purpose as presented previously;

it is able to install a user-selected version of a package (pip installs the newest available version by default); to achieve this goal you should use the following syntax:

# pip install package_name==package_version


# (note the double equals sign) e.g.,

# pip install pygame==1.9.2
