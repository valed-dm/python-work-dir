If any of the currently installed packages are no longer needed and you want to get rid of them, pip will be useful, too. Its uninstall command will execute all the needed steps.

The required syntax is clear and simple:

<!-- pip uninstall package_name -->


so if you don't want pygame anymore you can execute the following command:

<!-- pip uninstall pygame -->


Pip will want to know if you’re sure about the choice you're making – be prepared to give the right answer.
