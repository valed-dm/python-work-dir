1. A repository (or repo for short) designed to collect and share free Python code exists and works under the name Python Package Index (PyPI) although it's also likely that you come across a very niche name The Cheese Shop. The Shop's website is available at https://pypi.org/.


2. To make use of The Cheese Shop the specialized tool has been created and its name is pip (pip installs packages while pip stands for... ok, don't mind). As pip may not be deployed as a part of standard Python installation, it is possible that you will need to install it manually. Pip is a console tool.


3. To check pip's version one the following commands should be issued:

pip --version


or

pip3 --version


Check yourself which of these works for you in your OS' environment.


4. List of main pip activities looks as follows:

pip help operation - shows brief pip's description;
pip list - shows list of currently installed packages;
pip show package_name - shows package_name info including package's dependencies;
pip search anystring - searches through PyPI directories in order to find packages which name contains anystring;
pip install name - installs name system-wide (expect problems when you don't have administrative rights);
pip install --user name - install name for you only; no other your platform's user will be able to use it;
pip install -U name - updates previously installed package;
pip uninstall name - uninstalls previously installed package;
