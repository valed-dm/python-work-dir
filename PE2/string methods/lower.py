# The lower() method makes a copy of a source string, replaces all upper-case letters with their lower-case counterparts, and returns the string as the result. Again, the source string remains untouched.

# If the string doesn't contain any upper-case characters, the method returns the original string.

# Note: The lower() method doesn't take any parameters.

# Demonstrating the lower() method:
print("SiGmA=60".lower())
print("1234567890".lower())
