Introduction to the datetime module
In this section, you'll learn about a Python module called datetime.

As you can guess, it provides classes for working with date and time. 
If you think you don't need to delve into this topic, 
let's talk about examples of using date and time in programming.

Date and time have countless uses and it's probably hard to find a production application 
that doesn't use them. Here are some examples:

event logging — thanks to the knowledge of date and time, we are able to determine 
when exactly a critical error occurs in our application. 
When creating logs, you can specify the date and time format;

tracking changes in the database — sometimes it's necessary to store information about when a record 
was created or modified. The datetime module will be perfect for this case;

data validation — you'll soon learn how to read the current date and time in Python. 
Knowing the current date and time, we're able to validate various types of data, 
e.g., whether a discount coupon entered by a user in our application is still valid;

storing important information — can you imagine bank transfers without storing the information 
of when they were made? The date and time of certain actions must be preserved, and we must deal with it.

Date and time are used in almost every area of our lives, 
so it's important to familiarize yourself with the Python datetime module.
