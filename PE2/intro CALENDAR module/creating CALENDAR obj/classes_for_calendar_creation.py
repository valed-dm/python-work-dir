# Classes for creating calendars

# The presented functions aren't everything the calendar module offers.

# In addition to them, we can use the following classes:

# calendar.Calendar – provides methods to prepare calendar data for formatting;

# calendar.TextCalendar – is used to create regular text calendars;

# calendar.HTMLCalendar – is used to create HTML calendars;

# calendar.LocalTextCalendar – is a subclass of the calendar.TextCalendar class.
# The constructor of this class takes the locale parameter,
# which is used to return the appropriate months and weekday names.

# calendar.LocalHTMLCalendar – is a subclass of the calendar.HTMLCalendar class.
# The constructor of this class takes the locale parameter,
# which is used to return the appropriate months and weekday names.


# During this course, you've already had the opportunity to create text calendars when discussing the functions of the calendar module.

# Time to try something new. Let's take a closer look at the methods of the calendar class.
