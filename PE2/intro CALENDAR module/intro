-- Introduction to the calendar module

-- In addition to the datetime and time modules, the Python standard library provides 
-- a module called calendar which, as the name suggests, offers calendar-related functions.

-- One of them is of course displaying the calendar. 
-- It's important that the days of the week are displayed from Monday to Sunday, 
-- and each day of the week has its representation in the form of an integer:

-- Day of the week:	    Integer value:	        Constant:
--  Monday	                0	                calendar.MONDAY
--  Tuesday	                1	                calendar.TUESDAY
--  Wednesday	            2	                calendar.WEDNESDAY
--  Thursday	            3   	            calendar.THURSDAY
--  Friday	                4	                calendar.FRIDAY
--  Saturday	            5	                calendar.SATURDAY
--  Sunday	                6	                calendar.SUNDAY

-- The table above shows the representation of the days of the week in the calendar module. 
-- The first day of the week (Monday) is represented by the value 0 and the calendar.MONDAY constant, 
-- while the last day of the week (Sunday) is represented by the value 6 and the calendar.SUNDAY constant.

-- For months, integer values are indexed from 1, i.e., January is represented by 1, and December by 12. 
-- Unfortunately, there aren't constants that express the months.

-- The above information will be useful to you when working with the calendar module in this part of the course, 
-- but first let's start with some simple calendar examples.
