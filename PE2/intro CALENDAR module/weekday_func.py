# The weekday() function
# Another useful function provided by the calendar module is the function called weekday, 
# which returns the day of the week as an integer value for the given year, month, and day. 
# Let's see it in practice.

# Run the code in the editor to check the day of the week that falls on December 24, 2020.

import calendar
print(calendar.weekday(2022, 12, 10))

# Result:

# 3
# output

# The weekday function returns 3, which means that December 24, 2020 is a Thursday.
