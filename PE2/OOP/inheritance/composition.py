# Inheritance is not the only way of constructing adaptable classes. You can achieve the same goals (not always, but very often) by using a technique named composition.

# Composition is the process of composing an object using other different objects. The objects used in the composition deliver a set of desired traits (properties and/or methods) so we can say that they act like blocks used to build a more complicated structure.

# It can be said that:

# inheritance extends a class's capabilities by adding new components and modifying existing ones; in other words, the complete recipe is contained inside the class itself and all its ancestors; the object takes all the class's belongings and makes use of them;
# composition projects a class as a container able to store and use other objects (derived from other classes) where each of the objects implements a part of a desired class's behavior.
# Let us illustrate the difference by using the previously defined vehicles. The previous approach led us to a hierarchy of classes in which the top-most class was aware of the general rules used in turning the vehicle, but didn't know how to control the appropriate components (wheels or tracks).

# The subclasses implemented this ability by introducing specialized mechanisms. Let's do (almost) the same thing, but using composition. The class - like in the previous example - is aware of how to turn the vehicle, but the actual turn is done by a specialized object stored in a property named controller. The controller is able to control the vehicle by manipulating the relevant vehicle's parts.

# Take a look into the editor - this is how it could look.

# There are two classes named Tracks and Wheels - they know how to control the vehicle's direction. There is also a class named Vehicle which can use any of the available controllers (the two already defined, or any other defined in the future) - the controller itself is passed to the class during initialization.

# In this way, the vehicle's ability to turn is composed using an external object, not implemented inside the Vehicle class.

# In other words, we have a universal vehicle and can install either tracks or wheels onto it.

# The code produces the following output:

# wheels:  True True
# wheels:  True False
# tracks:  False True
# tracks:  False False
# output

class Tracks:
    def change_direction(self, left, on):
        print("tracks: ", left, on)


class Wheels:
    def change_direction(self, left, on):
        print("wheels: ", left, on)


class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, controller):
        self.controller = controller

    def turn(self, left):
        self.controller.change_direction(left, True)
        time.sleep(0.25)
        self.controller.change_direction(left, False)


wheeled = Vehicle(Wheels())
tracked = Vehicle(Tracks())

wheeled.turn(True)
tracked.turn(False)
