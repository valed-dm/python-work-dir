# Key takeaways

# 1. A class is an idea (more or less abstract) which can be used to create a number of incarnations
#  – such an incarnation is called an object.


# 2. When a class is derived from another class, their relation is named inheritance. 
# The class which derives from the other class is named a subclass. 
# The second side of this relation is named superclass. 
# A way to present such a relation is an inheritance diagram, where:

# superclasses are always presented above their subclasses;
# relations between classes are shown as arrows directed from the subclass toward its superclass.

# 3. Objects are equipped with:

# a name which identifies them and allows us to distinguish between them;
# a set of properties (the set can be empty)
# a set of methods (can be empty, too)

# 4. To define a Python class, you need to use the class keyword. For example:

class This_Is_A_Class:
     pass


# 5. To create an object of the previously defined class, 
# you need to use the class as if it were a function. For example:

this_is_an_object = This_Is_A_Class()
